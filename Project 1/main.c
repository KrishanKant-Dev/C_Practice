/*

Build a Number Guessing Game using loops, conditional statements, and a random number generator.

Requirements:
- The program generates a random number and repeatedly prompts the player to guess it.
- If guess > actual: display "Lower number please"
- If guess < actual: display "Higher number please"
- Continue the loop until the correct number is guessed.
- Display the total number of guesses taken upon winning.
